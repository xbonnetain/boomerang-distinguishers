# (Impossible) Boomerang distinguishers

This repository contains the source code associated to the articles [On Boomerang Attacks on Quadratic Feistel Ciphers](https://tosc.iacr.org/index.php/ToSC/article/view/11186) published in ToSC Volume 2023, Issue 3 and [On Impossible Boomerang Attacks](https://tosc.iacr.org/index.php/ToSC/article/view/11629) published in ToSC Volume 2024, Issue 2.

##### SMT models in ./SMT:
- SMT models are generated by katanSMTpython.py and simonSMTpython.py
- simonSMTpython supports all Simon versions and impossible boomerangs
- Raw outputs of the SMT solver can be found in ./SMT/out
- find_quartet_simon.py looks for quartets with some constraints. It can be used to find impossible boomerangs or check whether the output of simonSMTpython.py is instanciable.
- SMT outputs can be pretty-printed using `python3 [parse_katan.py|parse_simon.py] <output_file>`
- Pretty-printer also generates code snippets for C verification

##### MiniZinc models in ./minizinc:
- skinnyee.mzn contains an impossible boomerang model for MiniZinc.

Details on the models can be found in the articles.

##### Code for experimental tests in ./verification:
- katan.c contains optimized C code adapted from the reference implementation of Katan's designers (https://www.cs.haifa.ac.il/~orrd/KATAN/katan.c). It checks boomerang distinguishers.
- Simon functions are adapted from the [NSA reference implementation](https://nsacyber.github.io/simon-speck/implementations/ImplementationGuide1.1.pdf).
- simon_rk.c checks related-key boomerang distinguishers,
- simon_rx.c checks rotational-xor boomerang distinguishers,
- simon_rxd.c checks rotational-xor-differential boomerang distinguishers.
