#quadratic-feistel-boomerangs
Boomerang finding and testing utilities for Simon and KATAN. See the article for details.

Code for experimental test is in ./verification

SMT models are in ./SMT:
    - Models are generated by katanSMTpython.py and simonSMTpython.py
    - Raw output of the SMT solver used in the article can be found in ./SMT/out
    - SMT output can be pretty-printed using `python3 [parse_katan.py|parse_simon.py] <output_file>`
    - Pretty-printer also generates code snippets for C verification
